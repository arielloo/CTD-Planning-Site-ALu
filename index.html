<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my planning site!</h3>

<p>Hello there I am Ariel and I have three ideas about setting up a website that is actually useful and helpful to someone.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Language tutoring</h3>

<p>language tutoring is really popular in HK because most of the parents want their kids learn more than the others even though it's unnecessary to do that. Thus language tutoring (English, Mandarin,Korean and etc.) have a large market demand, and nowadays people (especially high school students) tend to look for language tutors online and contact with them.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Art material shop</h3>

<p>As an art students I concern so much about this. It's annoying and a pure waste of time if you come to an art shop and are told that they don't have the materials you are looking for. So it will be better if I can browse whether this shop has the brand/color/ tools I am looking for via its website.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cookery recipes sharing platform</h3>

<p>Cooking is fun! As more and people love to cook at home, they want to try more cuisines that searching recipe online is the fastest way. Additionally, people can share and upload their own recipes to the website that this website can be a communication platform for cooking lovers.</p>
